collatz_conjecture.py is command line program that allows a user to enter
an integer to test the Collatz Conjecture.
The collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics which given any integer
always yields a final result of 1.
This happens by choosing one of two algorithms based on whether a result is
odd or even.
